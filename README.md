# Study Buddies

## Project Overview
Study Buddies is a peer study support web application designed to help university students to
connect with each other for academic support. The platform is based on collaboration,
knowledge sharing, and building a supportive learning community without any financial exchange.
The project supports the theme of Sharing, exchange and building community by encouraging cooperative learning 
and exchange of knowledge in a non-commercial environment. Students can both provide and receive academic assistance, fostering to create an inclusive and supportive learning community.
