# Ethical Issues and Considerations (Study Buddies)

## 1. Privacy and personal data
- Users may share personal information (name, course, availability).
- Only collect the minimum data needed for matching.
- Store data securely and avoid exposing profiles publicly by default.

## 2. Safety and misuse
- The platform could be misused for harassment or unnecessary contact.
- Provide reporting/blocking tools and clear rules for behaviour.

## 3. Fairness and inclusion
- Ensure the app works for students of different backgrounds and confidence levels.
- Avoid design choices that favour only popular subjects or certain groups.

## 4. Consent and control
- Users should control what they share and who can contact them.
- Allow users to edit/delete their profile and messages where appropriate.

## 5. Academic integrity
- The app supports learning, but it should not encourage cheating.
- Include guidelines: peer support is allowed, sharing answers is not.

## 6. Data retention
- Don’t keep data forever.
- Plan to delete inactive accounts after a period (future improvement).
