## Activity Diagram
Two UML activity diagrams were created to model the system workflows for creating a study listing and viewing a user profile. The diagrams illustrate user interaction, validation logic, database operations, and system responses. These workflows guide the planned Express.js routes and MySQL queries for Sprint 3 implementation.

## Wireframe For Sprint 2
This project implements a multi-page user interface based on the Study Buddies wireframes. It allows students to view profiles, browse listings, and create study requests through a structured and consistent navigation system. The prototype demonstrates the transformation of wireframe designs into a functional interface that can later be integrated with a database.
