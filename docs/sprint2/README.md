## Wireframe For Sprint 2
It demonstrates the creation of a multi-page graphical user interface that was created in Python using Tkinter according to the Study Connect wireframe template. The goal of the project was to transform a low-fidelity drawing into an actual desktop application where students would be able to inquire about the user profiles, view listing of the studies, and build their own requests in terms of seeking academic assistance.

The application was developed on the basis of multi-frame structure, which ensures easy navigation between various pages, which includes; Users List, Listings Page, User Profile, Listing Detail and Create Listing page. To ensure that the interface would be consistent and user friendly on all screens, a reusable navigation bar was adopted.

The Users List page shows all the details of students such as courses and their skills tags so that the users can find their possible collaborators at a glance. Study requests on Listings page are displayed in an easily understandable format with the contents of title, module and the date/time scheduled but the Create Listing page has a dynamically growing interactive form that enables new listing to be added easily to the Listings page.

Overall, in this project, the practical aspects in the GUI design, event-based programming, and interface structuring are shown. It further emphasizes the possibility of converting wireframe ideas to a live prototype that could be extended in the later development with integration of database and other functionalities.
